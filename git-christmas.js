  // A partridge in a pear tree,
  // Two turtle doves,
  // Three french hens,
  // Four calling birds,
  // Five gold rings,
  // Six geese a-laying
  // Seven swans a-swimming,
  // Eight maids a-milking,
  // Nine ladies dancing,
  // Ten lords a-leaping,
  // Eleven pipers piping,
  // Twelve drummers drumming.
